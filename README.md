	I finished implementing the additive and multiplicative identities in the BinOpAst class such that phrases like x + 0 are simplified to x and x * 1 are to x. I also factored and finished the TreeOpTester class, which runs and logs tests cases for the identities. The tester is made to manage several test conditions, which facilitates the verification that the identities operate as expected.


	Completing this project taught me a lot, including the need of developing modular and reusable code, especially in complicated data structures. I was able to finish the implementation and testing process by dividing chores into smaller, well defined approaches and applying a flexible testing framework. This method encourages growth and wisdom for my future projects. 

	I did not enjoy my test cases failing stating, "cannot pop" because I was very lost on what this meant. Nevertheless, I tried and tried again until I realized that it wasn't my code failing, my code was actually doing its job. Instead, it was in my testbench that hindered my test cases from showing what I wanted to see.
